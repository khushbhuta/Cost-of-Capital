# Cost-of-Capital
This repository contains the code and reports for my assignment in the Financial Management course. The objective was to calculate the weighted average cost of capital of a firm using the top-down and bottom-up approaches.
The cost of debt was calculated using the EBIT ratios and the bond characteristics of the firm. The cost of equity was calculated by 2 approaches.
1. Top Down Approach: We calculated the beta by regressing the market returns and the returns of the firm.
2. Bottom Up Approach: We calculated the industry beta using the levering and unlevering technique and averaging the betas of all the companies in the same industry.
   
The weighted average cost of capital was calculated by getting data for the Debt/Equity ratios and Corporate Tax rates for the allotted firms.
